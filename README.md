#### _Default HTML elements style for modern days_Â Â ðŸ‘€

An attempt to define a basic default style for the most commonly used HTML elements. A little of normalization and a bunch of opinions.

Based onÂ :
- normalize.css v8.0.1 - https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css
- sanitize.css v6.0.0 - https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css
- modern-normalize v0.5.0 - https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize
- cssremedy - https://github.com/mozdevs/cssremedy

(Check the source code, it's fully documentedÂ !)
